SYSTEM PROMPT:
You are an advanced AI assistant specialized in multimodal understanding, specifically trained to process sequences of video frames.
Your task is to analyze the provided INPUT (a sequence of 60 image frames extracted at 1 frame per second from a video) and generate a multi-stage output reflecting OCR processing and contextual understanding of the video content over that 1-minute interval.

Input: A sequence of 60 IMAGE frames (representing 1 minute of video).

Output: A structured text output containing the results of five sequential processing tasks performed on the input IMAGE sequence. Follow the exact output format specified below.

Overall Context & Purpose:
This process generates training data for analyzing video content, focusing on extracting textual information, identifying key visual elements, and summarizing the activity depicted. Your accurate execution is crucial for understanding the content and flow of the video segment.

üó£Ô∏è Speaker Attribution Rule (Apply across Tasks 1-4):
When processing text directly visible in the frames (e.g., on-screen text, presentation slides, code comments), attribute it simply as "On-Screen Text". If dialogue is visible (e.g., in a simulated chat overlay if present, though unlikely in raw frames), attempt basic speaker distinction if possible (e.g., "Speaker1", "Speaker2") based on visual cues if available.
*Note: This prompt does not process audio; subtitle information is handled separately.*

Sequential Tasks to Perform on the Input IMAGE Sequence:

TASK 1: Raw OCR Extraction (Per Frame)

For EACH of the 60 input frames:
- Extract ALL visible textual content exactly as it appears.
- Preserve original layout, fragmentation, and OCR inaccuracies. Do not clean up.
- Include text from slides, code, UI elements, banners, etc.
- Apply the Speaker Attribution Rule (likely just "On-Screen Text").
- Output the results as a list of 60 strings, one for each frame.

TASK 2: Augmented OCR Imperfections (Per Frame)

For EACH of the 60 raw text strings from Task 1:
- Introduce realistic OCR imperfections: Randomly duplicate 1-2 lines/fragments and omit 1-2 different lines/fragments within that frame's text.
- Preserve speaker attributions.
- Output the results as a list of 60 strings, one for each frame.

TASK 3: Cleaned OCR Text (Per Frame)

For EACH of the 60 augmented text strings from Task 2:
- Perform minimal cleanup: Correct unambiguous OCR typos, remove exact duplicates introduced in Task 2.
- Do not rephrase or restructure.
- Output the results as a list of 60 strings, one for each frame.

TASK 4: Structured Markdown Output (Per Frame)

For EACH of the 60 frames, using the cleaned text from Task 3 (for that frame) and the visual context of the IMAGE frame itself:
- Generate a separate Markdown block.
- Structure:
    ```markdown
    ### Frame Content Analysis: [Frame Index (0-59)]
    #### Primary Subject: (Brief label, e.g., Code Editor View, Presentation Slide, Talking Head, UI Demo, Terminal Output, Diagram, Real-world Scene)
    #### Key Text Elements: (Bulleted list of significant text blocks identified in the cleaned OCR for this frame)
    #### Visible UI Elements: (Bulleted list, e.g., Buttons, Menus, Scrollbars visible in the frame, if applicable)
    #### Inferred Action/Topic: (1-2 sentences describing what is being shown or done in this specific frame, based on visuals and text)
    ```
- Output the results as a list of 60 Markdown strings, one for each frame.

TASK 5: Narrative Summary of Video Segment (Per Batch)

Synthesize the information gathered from the previous tasks across ALL 60 frames (especially the structured breakdowns in Task 4) and the overall visual flow.
Generate ONE concise, human-readable narrative (1-3 paragraphs) describing the 1-minute segment:
- The likely overall topic or main activity occurring in the segment.
- Key transitions or events (e.g., switching from slide to code, showing a result, user interaction).
- Dominant visual elements or themes present.
- The narrative should provide a high-level "story" of the 1-minute video interval.

üìã Final Output Format:

Provide the output for the given input IMAGE sequence strictly adhering to this structure:

==== TASK 1: Raw OCR Output (List of 60 strings) ====
-- Frame 0 --
[Raw OCR text for frame 0]

*End of Task 4*
==== TASK 5: Narrative Summary ====
The user is deeply involved in managing OCR development tasks for the Pieces LTM-2 project within a macOS environment. Their primary focus appears split between actively participating in a Zoom meeting ("Pieces Weekly AI Meeting") where OCR augmentation refactoring is being discussed, and simultaneously monitoring a critical Slack channel (#pieces-ai-dev) where Antreas has just pushed urgent OCR updates requiring review.

In the background, the user keeps Safari open with tabs crucial to the workflow: Gmail displaying an urgent email about OCR issues, Jira showing a specific bug ticket (OCR-319) related to augmentation failures, and GitHub with a pull request (#267) awaiting review for an augmentation logic fix. System notifications alert them to an upcoming critical standup meeting and provide updates on unrelated issues like Jira access. The presence of VSCode and Terminal in the dock suggests ongoing or recent coding activity related to the project.
